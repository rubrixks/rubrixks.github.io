<h1  style ="color:whitesmoke;">The Game.</h1>
<h2  style="color: whitesmoke;">What is "The Game"?</h2>
<div style="color: whitesmoke;">This is one of the oldest jokes on the internet, created long ago to troll anyone who has ever heard of this game.</h2>
<div style="color: whitesmoke;">The concept is simple. This is a mental game where the objective is to not think about The Game. Ever. That's it. </div>
<div style="color: whitesmoke;">I'd imagine most people go throughout their lives without ever hearing of The Game. Those are the lucky ones.</div>
<div style="color: whitesmoke;">There are variations to the rules of The Game, but for this iteration here are the rules:</div>
<div style="color: whitesmoke;">1.A player loses the game the moment the concept of The Game registers onto their minds.</div>
<div style="color: whitesmoke;">2.The player then has to announce to the internet they lost The Game.</div>
<div style="color: whitesmoke">3.Thereafter, don't think about it again. The Game never ends... it ends for the player when they croak. </div>

<h3  style="color: whitesmoke;">Why use Ethereum to announce you lost The Game?</h3>
<div style="color: whitesmoke;">You can announce your loss in many different ways. You can announce it to those around you. You can post it on your social media.</div>
<div style="color: whitesmoke;">But now you can post it on the Ethereum blockchain.</div>
<div style="color: whitesmoke;">This method is better for maintaining a global scoreboard. Through other sources it is difficult to measure metrics of The Game. </div>
<div style="color: whitesmoke;">With this method of recording, anyone can follow who has lost The Game, how often it thought about, and how The Game spreads through a network. All with a sort of anonymity.</div>
<div style="color: whitesmoke">As a community we can learn much about ourselves by having this information on a decentralized blockchain.</div>
